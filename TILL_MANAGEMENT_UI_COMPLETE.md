## Key Features

### Automatic Calculations
- System tracks all payments since last settlement
- Automatically deducts payouts from expected cash
- Calculates variance: `actual_cash - expected_cash`

### Period Tracking
- Start: Last settlement's end time (or beginning of day if first)
- End: Current timestamp when closing till
- Stored for historical reporting

### Variance Detection
- **Zero variance:** Perfect match (green)
- **Positive variance:** Cash over (green) - more than expected
- **Negative variance:** Cash short (red) - less than expected, needs investigation

### Payment Method Segregation
- Cash tracked separately from cards
- Gift cards tracked separately
- Each method shown in settlement report

### User Feedback
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Loading spinners during API calls
- Disabled buttons during processing
- Color-coded alerts for variance
