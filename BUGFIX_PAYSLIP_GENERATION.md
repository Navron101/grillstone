# Bug Fix: Payslip Generation Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Payslip Generation Getting Stuck

**Problem:**
When clicking "Generate Payslips", the button would get stuck in "Generating..." state and never complete.

**Root Cause:**
The employee had `pay_frequency = 'hourly'` but `hourly_rate = NULL`. The PayrollService was attempting to perform calculations with NULL values, causing the process to fail silently or hang.

**Solution:**
Added proper error handling in `PayrollService.php` to validate that employees have the required pay rate/salary configured based on their pay frequency:

```php
// For hourly employees
$hourlyRate = $employee->hourly_rate ?? 0;
if ($hourlyRate <= 0) {
    throw new \Exception("Employee {$employee->first_name} {$employee->last_name} has no hourly rate set");
}

// For weekly employees
if ($weeklyRate <= 0) {
    throw new \Exception("Employee {$employee->first_name} {$employee->last_name} has no weekly salary set");
}

// For fortnightly employees
if ($salaryAmount <= 0) {
    throw new \Exception("Employee {$employee->first_name} {$employee->last_name} has no fortnightly salary set");
}
```

Now when an employee is missing their pay configuration, the system will:
1. Show a clear error message identifying the employee
2. Not generate a payslip for that employee
3. Continue processing other employees
4. Return the error in the API response

### 2. TypeError: hours.toFixed is not a function

**Problem:**
JavaScript console error when viewing payslip details:
```
PeriodDetail.vue:783 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: hours.toFixed is not a function
```

**Root Cause:**
The database was returning numeric values as strings (common with MySQL/MariaDB), and the TypeScript formatting functions were expecting pure number types.

**Solution:**
Updated all formatting functions in `PeriodDetail.vue` to handle both string and number inputs:

```typescript
// Before
function formatHours(hours: number | null | undefined): string {
  if (hours === null || hours === undefined) return '0.00'
  return hours.toFixed(2)
}

// After
function formatHours(hours: number | string | null | undefined): string {
  if (hours === null || hours === undefined) return '0.00'
  const num = typeof hours === 'string' ? parseFloat(hours) : hours
  if (isNaN(num)) return '0.00'
  return num.toFixed(2)
}
```

Also updated:
- `formatCurrency()` - handles string/number amounts
- `centsToAmount()` - handles string/number/null/undefined
- `amountToCents()` - handles string/number inputs

### 3. "Stuck in Processing" Confusion

**Issue:**
User reported payslip being "stuck in processing" status.

**Clarification:**
This is **NOT a bug** - it's the correct workflow:

1. **Draft** → Period is created but payslips not yet generated
   - Shows: "Generate Payslips" button

2. **Processing** → Payslips have been generated but not yet approved
   - Shows: "Approve Period" button

3. **Approved** → Payslips are approved and ready to send
   - Shows: "Email Payslips" and "Mark as Paid" buttons

4. **Paid** → Payslips have been paid to employees
   - Shows: Period is complete

The "processing" status is the expected state after generation. The user should click the "Approve Period" button to move it to the next stage.

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `app/Services/PayrollService.php` (lines 50-90)
  - Added validation for hourly_rate
  - Added validation for weekly salary
  - Added validation for fortnightly salary
  - Better error messages

### Frontend
- `resources/js/pages/Payroll/PeriodDetail.vue` (lines 781-805)
  - Updated `formatHours()` to handle strings
  - Updated `formatCurrency()` to handle strings
  - Updated `centsToAmount()` to handle strings/null
  - Updated `amountToCents()` to handle strings

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Employee Without Rate
```bash
# Create employee with no rate set
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/employees \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "Employee",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "position": "Tester",
    "hire_date": "2025-10-20",
    "pay_frequency": "hourly"
  }'

# Try to generate payslip - should get clear error message
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/payroll/periods/1/generate
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "generated": 0,
  "errors": [
    {
      "employee_id": 2,
      "employee_name": "Test Employee",
      "error": "Employee Test Employee has no hourly rate set"
    }
  ],
  "payslip_ids": []
}
```

### 2. Test Successful Generation
```bash
# Update employee with hourly rate
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/employees/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hourly_rate": 1200}'

# Generate payslip - should succeed
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/payroll/periods/2/generate
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "generated": 1,
  "errors": [],
  "payslip_ids": [3]
}
```

### 3. Test Period Workflow
1. Navigate to `/payroll`
2. Click on a period
3. **Draft status** → Click "Generate Payslips" → Moves to "Processing"
4. **Processing status** → Click "Approve Period" → Moves to "Approved"
5. **Approved status** → Click "Email Payslips" → Sends emails
6. **Approved status** → Click "Mark as Paid" → Moves to "Paid"

## Employee Configuration Checklist

Before generating payslips, ensure each employee has:

**For Hourly Employees:**
- ✅ `pay_frequency = 'hourly'`
- ✅ `hourly_rate` set (e.g., 1200 JMD)
- ✅ `standard_hours_per_day` set (default: 8)
- ✅ `overtime_rate_multiplier` set (default: 1.5)

**For Weekly Employees:**
- ✅ `pay_frequency = 'weekly'`
- ✅ `salary_amount` set (e.g., 40000 JMD per week)
- ✅ `standard_hours_per_day` set (default: 8)
- ✅ `overtime_rate_multiplier` set (default: 1.5)

**For Fortnightly Employees:**
- ✅ `pay_frequency = 'fortnightly'`
- ✅ `salary_amount` set (e.g., 80000 JMD per fortnight)
- ✅ `standard_hours_per_day` set (default: 8)
- ✅ `overtime_rate_multiplier` set (default: 1.5)

## Example Payslip Calculation

**Employee:** Norvan Martin
- Pay Frequency: Hourly
- Hourly Rate: 1,200 JMD
- Regular Hours: 80 hours
- Overtime Hours: 10 hours
- Overtime Multiplier: 1.5

**Calculation:**
```
Regular Pay:    1,200 × 80 = 96,000 JMD
Overtime Pay:   1,200 × 1.5 × 10 = 18,000 JMD
Gross Pay:      96,000 + 18,000 = 114,000 JMD

Deductions:
NIS (3%):       114,000 × 0.03 = 3,420 JMD
NHT (2%):       114,000 × 0.02 = 2,280 JMD
Education (2.25%): 114,000 × 0.0225 = 2,565 JMD
PAYE:           Progressive tax = 14,076 JMD
Total Deductions: 22,341 JMD

Net Pay:        114,000 - 22,341 = 91,659 JMD
```
